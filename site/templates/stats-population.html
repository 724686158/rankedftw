  <p itemprop="about">
    Current and historic sc2 population counts for teams (not
    players). The data is calculated by counting all teams ranked in a
    season. If a player plays in multiple regions in identical teams
    that team will be counted several times for the world total. The
    region numbers are a more accurate way to count players. In 1v1
    and random teams each teams only consist of one player.

  <h2>Current {{ mode_id | mode_name }} Population</h2>
  <p>
    The current number of ranked teams in each region. Select version

  <h2>Comparing Seasons</h2>
  <p>
    It is not that easy to compare population between seasons since
    the seasons have different length and players play at irregular
    intervals. One more informative way to compare seasons is to
    compare the population when the season is a few weeks old,
    unfortunately that data is not available for season 15 and 16 so
    there is no graph option to display that. It is possible to only
    show the final ladder population in each season by selecting
    "Season Last" but note that the last season is not yet completed.
  </p>
  <h2>Games Played</h2>
  <p>
    Another measurement of population is average games played per day.
    The numbers are calculated as a delta of games played and days
    from the point before. It seems to always be more games played per
    day in the beginning of a season so the current season total
    average may not be that comparable.
